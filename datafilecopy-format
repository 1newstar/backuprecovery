run {
  backup incremental level 1 
    format '+MIGR' for recover of copy with tag migr 
    datafilecopy format '+MIGR'
    tablespace pdb:test_ts;
  recover copy of tablespace pdb:test_ts with tag migr;
}
---Another way to specify location for image copies in that case is an explicit channel configuration:
run {
  # allocate as many channels as needed
  allocate channel c1 device type disk format '+MIGR';
  backup incremental level 1 for recover of copy with tag migr tablespace pdb:test_ts;
  recover copy of tablespace pdb:test_ts with tag migr;
}
