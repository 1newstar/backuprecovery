select * from V$BACKUP_ASYNC_IO where type='AGGREGATE'

select * from V$BACKUP_ASYNC_IO where 1=1--type='AGGREGATE'

order by LONG_WAITS / IO_COUNT  desc;


Query V$BACKUP_ASYNC_IO
– Check EFFECTIVE_BYTES_PER_SECOND column (EBPS) for
row where TYPE = 'AGGREGATE'
– If EBPS < storage media throughput, run BACKUP VALIDATE
• Case 1: BACKUP VALIDATE time ~= actual backup time,
then read phase is the likely bottleneck
– Refer to RMAN multiplexing and buffer usage guidelines
– Investigate ‘slow’ performing files: find data file with highest
(LONG_WAITS / IO_COUNT) ratio
• If ASM, add disk spindles and/or re-balance disks
• Move file to new disk or multiplex with another ‘slow’ 


Case 2: If BACKUP VALIDATE time << actual backup time, then
buffer copy or write to storage media phase is the likely bottleneck
• Refer to backup compression and encryption guidelines
• If tape backup, check media management (MML) settings
– TCP/IP buffer size
– Media management client/server buffer size
– Client/socket timeout
– Media server hardware, connectivity to tape
– Enable tape compression (but not RMAN compression)

MAXPIECESIZE 
Just as a Backup can consist of multiple BackupSets, a BackupSet can consist of multiple BackupPieces. 
A BackupSet can consist of multiple datafiles and a datafile may be split across multiple BackupPieces. 
However, unlike the MAXSETSIZE that can be specified with the BACKUP command, MAXPIECESIZE is specified with the CONFIGURE CHANNEL. 
(However, unlike the MAXSETSIZE which runs a check before beginning the backup, this limit is applied when creating backuppieces !) 


MAXPIECESIZE: This option can't be specified in the clause "BACKUP", this must be specified in the clause "CONFIGURE". 
With this option you can set the Maximun Size of the Backup Piece. 
Note that RMAN will try to follow your value however it could be that RMAN create the Backup Piece with a size a little bit bigger or a little bit smaller. 
The value of MAXPIECESIZE must be between 1 Kb and 2048 Gb. In the following example I will show you how to set the maximum size to 50M and then we will confirm this with "du -sh":

RMAN> CONFIGURE CHANNEL DEVICE TYPE DISK MAXPIECESIZE 50M;
